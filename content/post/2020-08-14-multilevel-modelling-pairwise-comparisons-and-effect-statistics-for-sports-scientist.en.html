<h3>Why sports scientist should be familiar with mixed effects (multi-level) modeling and effect statistics…</h3>
<p>Skill in analyzing longitudinal data is particularly important for assessing phenomena that fluctuate over time. There are several important considerations when conducting longitudinal analysis including; accounting for the dependencies created by repeated measures, dealing with missing or unbalanced data (common occurrence in athlete monitoring practices), differentiating between-athlete from within-athlete variability, accounting for time-varying (e.g., workload, perceived fatigue) and time-invariant factors (e.g., sex, role, position) and establishing the influence of time <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6169745/">(Windt et al. 2018)</a>. Multi-level models are very useful to a sports scientist because they can handle aforementioned complexities that are a natural part of player tracking/monitoring.</p>
<p>Measuring the magnitude or strength of the change of a health or performance outcome can aid in the evaluation of the positive or negative consequences of an intervention or can be used to compare groups (e.g., male vs female, preseason vs. inseason, turf vs. grass surface). In order to assess change, difference betweeen mean group measures must be standardized. When comparing means, a common approach is using Cohen’s d, which is very similar to a standard difference score or z-score. Classic Cohen’s d requires a pooled standard deviation (SD) in the denominator and the mean difference in the numerator, while standard difference scores and z-scores typically using either between-athlete SD or control group SD (see below).</p>
<p>Cohen’s d Effect Size = (mean 1 – mean 2) ÷ between-athlete pooled SD</p>
<p>Standard Difference Score or Zscore = (mean 1 – mean 2) ÷ between-athlete SD</p>
<p>As mentioned, mixed models are unique becuase they can account for a number of variances (between-athlete/within-athlete, variability associated with time). However, this does present some issues when calculating classic cohen’s d directly from the model results because Cohen’s d was developed for between-subjects research. With that in mind, the aim of this post is to set up a basic mixed model with player tracking (workload) data in R and explore the number of options one has to calculate effect statistics from the results.</p>

<h1>Fit Mixed Effects Model with lme4</h1>
<p>With this model, we are doing a basic LMM, with Distance covered as our dependent variable, Season (preseason, inseason and postseason) as our independent variable (fixed effect) and we are clustering the data by athlete (random effect). Although one of the benefits of LMM is its abililtiy to incorporate multiple factors into a model (providing the ability to account for various contextual factors), for demonstration purposes we’ll keep the model as a simple univariate example.</p>

<h1>A More Detailed Summary…</h1>
<p>I prefer to use the <mark>tab_model()</mark> function in the sjPlot package by Daniel Lüdecke. You get a nice html table output that is publication worthy. There are several options to customize the table output, you can find that tutorial <a href="https://strengejacke.github.io/sjPlot/articles/tab_model_estimates.html">here</a>. In addition to the standard components you get with a traditional <mark>summary()</mark> output, <mark>tab_model()</mark> provides a few other components we need to interpet the model such as the ICC value and marginal/conditoinal R<sup>2</sup> values.</p>
<p>The higher the ICC value the more justified the use of LMM vs. a more traditional statistic (ANOVA in this instance). ICC’s can be interpeted as the proportion of variance explained by clustering. An ICC &gt; 0.1 is generally accepted as the minimal threshold for justifying the use of LMM, so in other words, at least 10% of the variance in Distance should be explained by clustering the observations by player.</p>

<p>In this instance, the ICC is 0.15 so the use of LMM is appropriate.</p>
<p>The other outputs of interest are our Marginal and Conditoinal R<sup>2</sup> values (calculated based on <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.2041-210x.2012.00261.x">Nakagawa et al.</a>). These show the proportion of variance explained by the fixed effect only (Marginal R<sup>2</sup>) and fixed + random effect (Conditional R<sup>2</sup>), respectively.</p>
<p>So for this model, we would could conclude that season phase is explaining very little (~1%) about the distance covered in each session. It’s important to have this context becuase although there are significant differences in distance covered between the season phases, season phase by itself is not a meaninful determinant of session distance. On the other hand, the conditional R<sup>2</sup> is ~0.16, so we can see that the proportion of variance explained by the combination of season and accounting for individual variance is much higher. The marginal R<sup>2</sup> is 0.01 (fixed effect) and the ICC is 0.15 (random effect), so a conditional R<sup>2</sup> of 0.16 makes sense.</p>

<h1>Visualize Data</h1>
<p>If you want to visualize the model (or any other mixed effects model [generalized, ordinal, etc.]), I would recommend using the ggeffects package (also by Daniel Lüdecke) combined with ggplot2 functions. You can find the ggeffects tutorial <a href="https://strengejacke.github.io/ggeffects/">here</a>. You can use the <strong>fit</strong> object with <mark>ggpredict()</mark> to create a data frame for plotting, pass a <mark>plot()</mark> function, and then add *<mark>ggplot2()</mark> functions as needed to clean up the visualization. Here is a sample output from <mark>ggpredict()</mark>.</p>

<h1>Fit Tukey for Pairwise Comparisons</h1>
<p>Since the model summary indicates we have some significant differences in session distance by season phase, the next step is to compare the levels against each other to see where the differences lie. We can tell by the model <mark>summary()</mark> output that Inseason and Postseason are significantly different than Preseason (model intercept), but we want to run this model through a post hoc test to confirm where the differences are.</p>

<p>As expected based on the model summary, both inseason and postseason session loads are less than the preseason. This makes sense. Preseason is used as a prepatory period and is accompanied by increased player loading.</p>
<p>Another important thing to note here, the difference estimates from this Tukey are the same as the lmer model summary, so we can also use these as our mean differences for the effect size calculations.</p>

<div id="calculating-effect-sizes" class="section level1">
<h1>Calculating Effect Sizes</h1>
<p>There isn’t a consensus on the best or preferred method of calculating effect sizes from within-subject designs. I’m also not aware of any packages that compute standardized effect sizes directly from a lmer object. Jake Westfall goes into great detail <a href="http://jakewestfall.org/blog/index.php/2016/03/25/five-different-cohens-d-statistics-for-within-subject-designs/">here</a> on the subject, detailing several of the ways cohens d and d-like effect sizes can be estimated. The important thing to note here is transparency when reporting a standardized effect size.</p>
<div id="option-1-classical-cohens-d-calculation" class="section level2">
<h2>Option 1: Classical Cohen’s D Calculation</h2>
<p>First, we can separate out the players distances by season.</p>

inseason_data &lt;- data %&gt;% filter(Season == &quot;Inseason&quot;) %&gt;% dplyr::select(Distance)

I’m not using the absolute value of the mean difference - as in the original cohen equation - so we can see the direction of the effect.</p>

<h2>Option 2: Standardized Effect Size using Residual Standard Deviation</h2>
<p>This option is somewhat popular because the residual standard deviation is often assumed equivalent to the between-subjects standard deviation.

<h2>Option 3: Standardized Effect Size using All Variance Components</h2>
<p>We need all random effect variance components, which in this model are both the residual and within-athlete variances. You’ve already seen these variances in the model summary, so these calculations can be done simply by hand, but since we’re using R lets extract them using <mark>VarCorr()</mark> and take the square root of the sum of both variance components.</p>

<h3>Add Effect Size Interpretations</h3>
<p>Lastly, we can add interpretations to these effects. There have a been different propositions regarding the qualitative interpretation of ES’s. The original interpretation given by Cohen suggests &lt;0.5 is a small effect, 0.5 to 0.7 is a moderate effect, and &gt;0.8 is interpreted as a large effect. More recently Hopkins suggested a revised scale with threshold values at 0.2 (small), 0.6 (moderate), 1.2 (large), 2.0 (very large) and &gt;4 (nearly perfect).</p>

<p>As noted earlier and worth mentioning again, there are a number of ways to calculate standardized effect sizes and there really is not one “right” way. Using residual SD and the square root of the sum of variance components from a mixed model for standardization are not traditional Cohen’s d statistics, so they should be referred to as standardized effect sizes. What we noticed from this dataset is that using the residual variance and all variance components in the denominator produced similar effect statistics becuase the within-athlete variability was quite small compared to the between-athlete variability. However, both methods produced noticably different results than what we got by calculating cohen’s d directly from the data. The important thing is to detail which method you are using and make sure to label it appropriately.</p>
