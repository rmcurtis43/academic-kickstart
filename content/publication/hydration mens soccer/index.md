abstract: "Objectives: To investigate the roles that training load and environmental conditions have on fluid balance during a collegiate men's soccer preseason. Design: Observational study. Methods: Twenty-eight male collegiate soccer players (mean±SD; age, 20±1.7y; body mass (BM), 79.9±7.3kg; height, 180.9±6.8cm; body fat, 12.7±3.1%; VO2max, 50.7±4.3ml·kg-1·min-1) participated in this study. Prior to (PRE) and following (POST) each team session, BM, percent BM loss (%BML) and hydration status was measured. Participants donned a heart rate and GPS enabled monitor to measure training load. For all team activities, ambient temperature (TAMB) and relative humidity (RH) were obtained from the nearest local weather station. Participants consumed 500mL of water as part of the team-based hydration strategy before and after training session. Stepwise linear regression was used to identify the variables that predicted %BML. Significance was set a-priori p<0.05. Results: Total distance covered predicted %BML during all preseason activities (r2=0.253, p<0.001), with TAMB and RH further adding to the model (r2=0.302, p<0.001). %BML never exceeded 2% of BM during any one session and daily variation in BM was <1% from baseline measures. Urine specific gravity was greater than 1.020 on 12/15days and UCOL was above 4 on 13/15days, indicating a state of hypohydration. Conclusions: Total distance covered was the best predictor for the extent of body water losses during a collegiate preseason. While the team-based hydration strategy during preseason was successful in minimizing fluid losses during activity, participants arrived hypohydrated 80% of the time, necessitating a greater focus on daily fluid needs."
