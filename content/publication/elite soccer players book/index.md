abstract: "The sport of soccer has evolved immensely since its beginning around 2,000 years ago and is now considered the most popular sport in the world. The research related to the physical, psychological, and tactical aspects of the game has risen in conjunction with its fame. Elite Soccer Players: Maximizing Performance and Safety seeks to inform the reader with the most current research connected to optimizing physical performance and reducing the risk of injury of the elite soccer athlete for a variety of ages. After providing an initial brief overview of applying physical and psychological scientific concepts in soccer (*Part I: Laying the Foundation*), this book then takes the reader through a series of important yet novel parts including: *Athlete Monitoring and Data Analysis*, *Optimizing Physical Performance*, *Injury Epidemiology and Risk Reduction*, *Achieving Peak Performance and Safety in Various Environmental Conditions*, and *Unique Aspects of the Game*. The goal of Elite Soccer Players: Maximizing Performance and Safety is to conceptualize and expand upon the current research associated with these topics and provide an applicable point of view to the coaches, sport scientists, strength and conditioning coaches, and sports medicine professionals who work with these athletes every day."
